To build the documentation, after cloning the repository, navigate to the Documentation folder and run *make html*.\r\n\r\nMODOI is an implementation of the Birkhoff curve shortening procedure using a technique devised by Schwetlick-Zimmer to compute local geodesics. It is currently implemented in Python using multiprocessing to distribute the computing.\r\n\r\n### Who do I talk to? ###\r\n\r\n* For questions about the project please contact Daniel Sutton.\r\n\r\n* For scientific queries please contact Johannes Zimmer.\r\n","google":"UA-55721589-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
